<p>East Africa's most cosmopolitan city, Nairobi is the beating heart of Kenya, an exciting, modern city that counterpoints the untrammelled natural beauty to be found elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p>The city had a population of over 4.3 million in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a projected population in 2022 of 10.8 million. Nairobi is commonly referred to as The Green City in the Sun.</p>

<p>Nairobi was founded in 1899 by colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda - Kenya Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After Kenya's independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya.</p>
  
<p>During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies in the south central part of Kenya, at an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft).</p>
